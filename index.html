    <section class="home-page">This is the home page for whatever this is to become. Some ideas include
        a resume, or just a simple tutorial project with several ideas all added in. This
        could lead to a decent job doing this type of work. This section will need a class. Best 
        idea is to edit the CSS and add classes to certain things. Also learn to add images and JavaScript.
        Other ideas could be to make this a tutorial type page and something to show in an interview.
